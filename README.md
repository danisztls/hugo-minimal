# Hugo Minimal Template
This is a minimal but not bare template for quickly deploying Hugo projects from scratch. Cloning this is arguably better than running `hugo new site <dir>`.

## Design
This is both a sandbox where I try new things and a place where I synthesize lessons learned over the time. My aim is to have a small core of features and a bunch of extra functionality available as modules.

## Features
- Base style
- Web vitals optimizations
- Sass & JS building
- Image processing
- Image lightbox
- WebFonts
- SVG sprite
