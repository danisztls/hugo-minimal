This is a minimal but not bare template for quickly deploying Hugo projects from scratch. Cloning this is arguably better than running `hugo new site <dir>`.

It include a few batteries:

- Base style
- Web vitals optimizations
- Sass & JS building
- Image processing
- Image lightbox
- WebFonts
- SVG sprite
